We are developing an interactive visualization tool primarily that includes a chloropleth map, scatter plots, box plots, pie charts, etc with the aim to illustrate the segregation and inequality present in Seattle's various neighborhoods, focusing on socio-economic factors and racial disparities. Our primary dataset for this visualization is census data, which provides a comprehensive overview of the city's population. Additionally, we plan to incorporate one or more supplementary datasets to enhance the depiction of specific aspects of inequality.
The visualization begins by allowing users to select the aspect of inequality they wish to explore. This could include income disparities, education gaps, infrastructure discrepancies, and more. Upon selection, the tool displays primary visualizations related to the chosen aspect, providing users with a clear understanding of the overall patterns and trends.
Users are then able to choose a specific demographic group, such as racial or ethnic categories, and observe its distribution on the map. This feature enables users to visualize the concentration and dispersion of different demographic groups across Seattle's neighborhoods.
Furthermore, the tool empowers users to select one or multiple districts within the city to view the corresponding data in the visualizations. For instance, if we have a primary box plot that shows graduation rate in each grade, after choosing districts one can see the median of graduation rate in each grade on the plot too and compare it to the box plot. By doing so, users can gain insights into how various socio-economic factors and racial inequality manifest themselves within specific neighborhoods.
To facilitate comparative analysis, users also have the option to choose two groups of neighborhoods. The visualizations dynamically update, allowing users to discern the differences between these selected groups. This feature enables a deeper exploration of disparities and highlights the contrasting characteristics between neighborhoods.
Overall, our interactive visualization tool provides users with an accessible and informative way to explore and understand the complex dynamics of socio-economic factors, racial inequality, and segregation within Seattle's diverse neighborhoods.
